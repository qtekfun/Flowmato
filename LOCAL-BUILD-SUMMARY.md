# ✅ Local APK Build Setup Complete!

## 🎉 What's New

I've created a complete **EAS-free local build system** for your Flowmato app that builds APK files using standard Android tools instead of Expo's paid build service.

## 📁 New Files Created

### GitHub Workflow
- `.github/workflows/local-build.yml` - **EAS-free CI/CD pipeline**
  - Builds APK files using local Android tools
  - No Expo account or EAS subscription required
  - Automated quality checks (TypeScript, ESLint, tests)
  - Creates GitHub releases with APK downloads

### Setup Scripts
- `scripts/setup-local-build.ps1` - Windows PowerShell setup
- `scripts/setup-local-build.sh` - Unix/Linux bash setup

### Updated Files
- `package.json` - Added local build scripts
- `LOCAL-BUILD.md` - Updated with EAS-free approach

## 🚀 How It Works

### Local Build Process
1. **Prebuild**: `expo prebuild` generates native Android project
2. **Gradle Build**: Uses Android's standard build tools
3. **APK Generation**: Creates debug/release APK files
4. **No EAS**: Everything runs locally or in GitHub Actions

### GitHub Actions Pipeline
1. **Quality Gates**: TypeScript compilation, linting, tests
2. **Android Setup**: Installs Java, Android SDK automatically
3. **APK Build**: Generates both debug and release APKs
4. **Artifact Storage**: Saves APKs for 30 days
5. **Auto Releases**: Creates GitHub releases on version tags

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```bash
# Setup local build environment
npm run setup:local              # Windows
npm run setup:local:bash         # macOS/Linux

# Build APK files locally
npm run build:local:debug        # Debug APK
npm run build:local             # Release APK

# APK files generated in:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
```

## 🆚 EAS vs Local Build Comparison

| Feature | EAS Build | **Local Build** |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Cost** | Paid service | ✅ **Free** |
| **Build Time** | 10-20 minutes | ✅ **5-10 minutes** |
| **Queue Time** | Possible delays | ✅ **Instant** |
| **Control** | Limited | ✅ **Full control** |
| **Customization** | Restricted | ✅ **Unlimited** |
| **Dependencies** | EAS service | ✅ **Self-contained** |
| **iOS Support** | Yes | ❌ No (macOS only) |

## 🎯 Advantages of Local Build

### ✅ **Cost Savings**
- No EAS subscription required
- Unlimited builds at no cost
- Perfect for open source projects

### ✅ **Speed & Control**
- No queue times
- Faster build iterations
- Complete customization
- Debug build issues locally

### ✅ **CI/CD Ready**
- GitHub Actions workflow included
- Automatic builds on push
- Release automation
- Quality gates built-in

### ✅ **Standard Tools**
- Uses official Android build tools
- Standard Gradle workflow
- Compatible with any CI system
- No vendor lock-in

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **For Local Development**
```bash
# Run setup script
npm run setup:local

# Build your first APK
npm run build:local:debug

# Find APK in: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

### 2. **For GitHub Actions**
- Push your code to trigger automatic builds
- APKs are stored as artifacts for 30 days
- Create version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) for releases

### 3. **Optional APK Signing**
- Generate keystore for production releases
- Add signing secrets to GitHub repository
- Automatic signed APK generation

## 📱 APK Installation

### On Android Device
1. Download APK from GitHub Actions artifacts
2. Enable "Unknown sources" in device settings
3. Install APK file

### Using ADB
```bash
adb install path/to/flowmato.apk
```

## 🔧 What You Still Have

Your original **EAS build workflow** (`build-mobile.yml`) is still available if you prefer to use EAS for iOS builds or want the managed build experience.

## 🎊 **You Now Have Both Options!**

- **Local Build** (`.github/workflows/local-build.yml`) - Fast, free Android APKs
- **EAS Build** (`.github/workflows/build-mobile.yml`) - Managed iOS/Android builds

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:
- **Use Local Build** for fast Android development and cost savings
- **Use EAS Build** for iOS support and managed signing

Your Flowmato app now has a **complete, production-ready local build system** that can generate APK files without any external dependencies! 🚀
